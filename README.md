[PROJECT STILL IN PROGRESS!<br>
<b>Description:</b> A stock market brokerage program for practice (incl. market/limit/stop-loss/stop-limit/trailing-stop day/GTC orders, buy/sell/short/buy-to-cover actions) on historical stock market prices (1925-2024) at desired market progression speed; implemented in Java, HTML/CSS, and SQL using SpringBoot and JDBC.
<br>
<b>Practice mission:</b> SQL, SpringBoot, stock market concepts, responsive web design

All stock-market-history data was retrieved from Google Finance.<br>

Yet to do: pretty much everything (I have the general structure written down into the source code but no functional implementation)

Java source code found in `src/main/java/com.stockbrokeragesim.Stock.Brokerage.Simulator` as `StockBrokerageSimulatorApplication`.
